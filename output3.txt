1.I bought my iPhone 4 in 2009 (Incidentally, it cost as much then as it does now!).Its seen me through 3 new iPhone releases, but continues to be a decent, usable smartphone. Given Apple's ability to control the ecosystem, this phone continues to get the latest iOS releases along with the newer versions. The latest release (iOS 7) though seems to really stretch this phone. I think this is probably the last OS update that the iPhone 4 is going to see.Based on having owned this phone as long as I have, here's my take on the Pros & Cons, vs Android phones that may cost as much:Pros:- Access to the latest iOS experience, without having to pay a bomb for it- Perfectly usable screen (retina display; can't go wrong with it)- Most apps, including graphic intensive games, continue to be usable- Battery life is decent; (can last for a day and a half with moderate usage)- Call voice quality is great;- Vs Android Phones: Ease of Use(Idiot Proof); better app quality (UI, responsiveness)- Very Durable; dropped it 50+ times- nothing!Cons:- Camera quality can no longer be called 'great'(5MP); Great for instagram, not much else. Same goes for video- End of the road from an upgradation perspective (Don't see this getting iOS 7+)- Phone speakers are not especially loud; I frequently miss calls- No LTE; A concern if you're in a city that's seeing 4G/LTE connectivity (Pune, Bangalore, Kolkata)Conclusion:This phone was amazing 4 years ago, but that was when Android phones were just beginning to become good. Things have changed. The Nexus 4 / Samsung Duos or even the Micromax/ Karbonn phones offer much better value from a specs / rupee perspective.The only way I'd recommend this phone to someone is if they're looking to experience an Apple phone for the first time, but cannot afford to go all the way. It's a great usable phone, and you won't miss the frills that an android phone offers. If however, you're a stickler for features, and want the most bang for your buck, you should be looking at other alternatives.

2.iphone 4 is comparable to Windows Xp. Gold standard for any smartphone and difficult to replace by Apple. Same story as windows Xp as till date microsoft is struggling to find a replacement.

3.Overall a good phone who are starting with apple. I got a good bargain and cetainly good value for my money.

4.the best smartphone till date...IPHONE 4 even though getting outdated but still better way better than other latest smartphones..

5.I am happy with the delivery of the product. Firstly I saw some negative feedback from various user and got disappointed that I took the wrong decision by ordered this from this website.But when I got my product and I happy with the product.Keep up the good work !!

6.I phone is i phone..not like other biscuit phone....dignity of use..royalty..always looks great Great great great..greatAmozon  is good ..rocking

7.It was well expected that I phone will be great ! I choose Iphone 4 as it was markedly cheaper than Iphone 5 .

8.Overall the phone is just okay..... the battery life is disgusting and phone is a bit slow. Features are complex.

9.It is good! I would like to buy more gadgets from amazon! Keep up the good work!Cheers :D :D

10.excellent displayexcellent touchaverage camera qualityexcellent response no hanging problem like androidsbattery performance is  also good .

11.This phone is quite a few years old but still a good buy. The UI of Iphone 4 is cool.

12.This phone is no doubt made by the most quality conscious smartphone maker in the present world. But, its being really long time since this phone has been launched and still one has to pay such an exorbitant amount to buy an old piece of gadget. Its high time for Apple to reduce its older models like this one to at least 9,000 Rupees, given the fact that all it supports is just 8 GB of memory and the specs of an entry level smartphone in todays world. Purchase of this phone for 22,000 Rupees would definitely be the joke of the day. I recommend prospective buyers who are into iPhone to better buy Apple iPhone 5 C when its released rather than wasting money on this outdated junk.

13.Was an Apple fan for a long time...but was shockingly surprised with this particular product...I agree it was a three generations old phone but nevertheless I expect some quality from the so called expert company. The basic functionality of the mobile device was not working! Now...what kind of quality check happened here? If Apple is so hell bent on clearing the stock, please throw it off for free...but never fool people with faulty products when you charge a premium for the products you sell. Very disappointed...Perhaps Amazon should stop selling their 'old' products...

14.Worst phone ive ever bought I bought the phone and from next only its speakers started dis functioning then I went to change my phone at apple service centre they took my phone and asked me to come after a week and then I went there after a week and took the replaced handset and then again a new problem occurred in the replaced handset that only after a week the switched off and didnt even switched on after many efforts.............

15.I requested for replacement but you didn't do thatI received a def. product. but Reseller even not bother for replacement.. !

16.I dont have to write more, I ordered this for my friend who wanted iOS experience and she is enjoying it. So, no words at all.

17.Anyone who is planning to buy this phone understands this is two generations old. No doubt this is too expensive, but again like any Apple product, the quality and user experience you get is top notch. That is what you pay for. I bought this for my dad a couple of months back, with the 7K cashback offer. At this price, I do believe it's well worth it. Like what other users have mentioned, I would have liked Apple to keep the prices further down given this is an old model, therefore, I am taking away one star. The camera is sub-par, this not an issue for me as I prefer to use my SLR for photography.Please ignore the one star reviews, they are not real customers. And they probably have never owned a iPhone.

18.Its really a amazing phone from apple. But i have some expection from it and i like to suggest apple for it.
