Excellent phone. Works flawlessly. Only thing i could do without was having to cut my mini sim to micro SIM.Also, the phone ships with Android 4.2.2, not 4.1 as advertised.EDIT:After using it a few days now, I've discovered that the phone lacks a gyroscope sensor. This means that you will not be able to use the phone to play tilt to steer games like Need for speed. You will also NEVER be able to get photosphere camera working on this phone as that needs a gyro.The remaining features work like a charm. It's been fast and responsive(even after installing a lot of apps.... I've installed about 50 apps so far and no noticeable lag yet) and I get a full day's usage out of it even with 3g turned on all day.EDIT 2:The camera as of now, has some severe autofocus issues. autofocus does not seem to work very well in general resulting in blurry photos but the problem is severe in case of low light. Also, the camera does not seem so sensitive. Most samsung cameras and my x10 minipro camera are leagues ahead.. one star off!

This mobile is not so good as I expected. Before purchasing this mobile, I was using HTC desire s. I was pretty satisfied with HTC. Touch & camera of sony is not good as HTC. But accoding to price , xperia m dual justifes its price.Good hardware- 1 ghz dual core processor, 1 gb ram.4 Gb internal memory is a matter for this mobile, because 2 gb  is available for end user. We can't move applicaion to memory card.

But having one limitation, internal memory only 4 GB and usable only 2GB.All apps gets downladed in to Internal memory so that we can have only limitted apps. We need to move apps manully to storage area, to free the meory.

A very good smartphone from Sony at this price point. Easily beats some of the best phones in its category. No brainer at its category.

Good phone with good performance.camera quality is not that good as expected from Sony brand. It is worth to buy.

i liked it and was easy to work, sound is good. after all that is the main purpose of a phone to hear one other clearly.apps are ok,done side, one have to keep an eye on the battery, but not a problem as one can charge anywhere and anytime these days.go for it

The phone is awesome, it include almost all the features of more costlier phone.The graphics is good and phone doesn't hang on doing heavy things

If you want to purchase a smartphone at this range then this is the best one.The voice clearity is excellent. Speakers really rock.As far as gaming experience goes it wirks completely lag free.The best fone ever................. :)

worth the money paid for.Easy operationBattery life seems to be goodUser friendly and has a responsive touch screen

ProsNice touchDecent battery life(if not playing too many games)ConsCamera is not good2 GB internal memory.

This Xperia M dual is a lovely machine to have in hand.I really like the light sensor that illuminates the screen according the external light intensity.This is really lovely under the sun.The telephony and network reception is great. The only negative point, i found in the phone is the picture from the camera. The photography from the Xperia is not amazing. Its just manageable.

Good phone and Good Amazon service.Appreciate it!Don't buy this If incase you are looking for a camera .This is not meant for it.Features you can see anywhere its the same as SONY has mentioned.Go get it! Worth the price!Also remember a phone's configuration output depends on the wayyou use it.

I bought this phone last month, every thing is good apart from the camera quqlity is some what bad when compared to other smart phones in this range ,,,,, i love this mobile and the phone seems to be looking good and also unique from other smar phones.... worth to buy it and have great fun over this phone ..... Amazon is providing good service and have a glimpse on fullfilled when you place order in this site. They are good for their commitments.... One more thing you may see price difference between other online dealers .... I suggest to go for this phone and go for Amazon ....

Battery capacity is just half a day when using net. Getting hot easily. Other features are good. Battery capacity has to be increased

i m realy happy to use this phone sony xperia m dual . exelent performance & much better than samsung

sony you beauty, worth it, will definitely recommend. dual sim only memory could have been better but it is still awesome

Very good phone.battery life is max 1 day. But amazon website show citi card cash back offer which didnt'. Come..read terms and condition before purchase

BEST PHONE WITH THE BEST PRICE.one of the finest smartphones plus great cost by amazon.in.expecting more good deals and offers.

I'm very satisfied with the delivery of the product by Amazon but when it comes to the device performance then it is pertinent to mention that the battery of the phone is not satisfactory for any office going person using internet on the go.Otherwise the device is well packed with other features in its price range and not to forget that o for this device only if you can sacrifice on your camera expectations from a phone in this budget.

it was good and meet my requirements. i will kjh hkh jkhlk  hl kjhljh j h kj hlkh  jkhkkjh h
